A JavaScript-based Wordle-style game updated daily where the player guesses a randomly selected BLEACH character! Project is an active WIP, but is officially fully-functional, beautified, and live at <a href="">https://tybwardle.com</a>!

Using vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3, I was able to create a game inspired by the New York Times' Wordle game that allows for players to guess a new random character, updated daily! External images sourced from the <a href="https://bleach.fandom.com/wiki/Bleach_Wiki">official BLEACH wiki</a> and an <a href="https://watercss.kognise.dev/">external style sheet</a> were used for the creation of this game!

## TO-DO:
1. Fully complete mobile optimization (about 80-90% formatted).
2. ~~Create cron job that automatically updates today.json with a random entry from characters.json for the random daily characters!~~ âœ…
3. Add share results functionality (JavaScript mailing function(?))
4. Add login/save results function (convert to .php, add MySQL)
